Moebius Beyond is an ASCII/ANSI Art Editor for MacOS, Linux and Windows.

This repo is a fork of the original project. The rough timeline is as follows...

- **2019** - andyh develops [Moebius](https://github.com/blocktronics/moebius) as a modern, cross-platform alternative to [PabloDraw](https://github.com/blocktronics/pablodraw) for creating ANSI Art.
- **2021** - hlotvonen forks as [Moebius XBIN](https://github.com/hlotvonen/moebius) to add support for custom fonts and colors.
- **2023** - grymmjack forks as [Moebius XBIN GJ! Edition](https://github.com/grymmjack/moebius) to add various quality of life improvements.
- **2025** - michael-lazar forks as [Moebius XBIN Ultimate Edition](https://github.com/michael-lazar/moebius-xbin-ultimate) to add more quality of life improvements.
- **2025** - michael-lazar renames to [Moebius Beyond](https://github.com/michael-lazar/moebius-beyond) to distinguish from the upstream project.

There was an early version of Moebius that ran directly in a web browser. This was _also_ forked, and is maintained over at [moebius-web](https://github.com/xero/moebius-web) by xero.

If you're only interested in traditional "scene" ANSI Art, you may prefer the original Moebius. The original project is still maintained (semi-actively) and is the only one that supports the collaborative server feature.
