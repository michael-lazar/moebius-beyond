            <p>
                Your document contains control characters such as a Horizontal
                Tabulation (#9), Newline (#10), Carriage Return (#13) or
                Substitute (#26).
            </p>
            <p>
                While editors such as Moebius and Pablodraw will display the
                printable version of the character and exporting to PNG or
                BIN/XBIN is safe, saving a document in a textmode format such as
                ANS, ASC or DIZ might cause unexpected behavior in DOS
                viewers/editors, other text terminals or converters which are
                true to ANSI.SYS such as ansilove. These renderers might show
                unexpected output like shifted characters or unexpected broken
                or empty lines. If you care about compatibility and wish your
                creation to be perceived as created, it would be best to avoid
                these characters.

            Press Cancel to return to the document, press OK to continue with
            saving.
